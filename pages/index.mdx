# Introduction Nextra v3

Nextra v3, released on September 28, 2024, is a significant update to the Nextra framework, enhancing its capabilities for building content-focused websites atop Next.js. 

A major advancement in this version is the transition to MDX 3, enabling seamless integration of React components, variable interpolation, and LaTeX within the table of contents. 

The update also introduces a new styling approach for code blocks, aligning with Next.js aesthetics, and incorporates 'shikiji' for syntax highlighting, replacing 'shiki'. 

To enhance customization, Nextra v3 removes support for '_meta.json' files, advocating the use of `_meta.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}` instead, allowing for more dynamic configurations. 


The release also discontinues certain components and exports, such as **Steps**, **Callout**, **Tabs**, **Tab**, **Cards**  and 'FileTree', which are now available from 'nextra/components'.
