# Quick Start

Adder is a tool for tailing the Cardano blockchain and emitting events for each block and transaction seen, based on user configurable filters. These events can be processed in other event-based toolchains to produce rich and reactive applications for Cardano.

Basically, Adder lets you track events you care about, and you can get notified in the way you prefer. For example, Adder can send you a desktop notification when a payment is sent to any wallet address that you want to track. Or maybe you want to be notified in Discord when your Stake Pool Operator (SPO) mints a block. Adder can track the different Cardano blockchain events that you care about and notify you when they occur.
