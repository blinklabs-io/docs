# Watch a Token and get a Desktop Notification

In this example we will use Adder to send us a desktop notification when there is a transaction that includes a certain token or asset that we want to track.

> ‚úÖ For this guide we assume you have already downloaded the Adder exe and have opened a command prompt. If not see our [Quick Start](../quick-start/quick-start-overview.md) guide.

***

Let us start by picking an asset that we want to follow.

## Step 1 - Get Asset ID / Fingerprint

In order to filter by a Token that we want to watch we need the asset id also known as the asset fingerprint. We can use tools like [cexplorer.io](https://www.cexplorer.io) to search by a token name so we can get the asset id / asset fingerprint.

üìùMake note of the asset fingerprint, we will need it later. For this example, we used the following asset id / asset fingerprint:

```
asset1uaxup2yv695uat3chgwqtpg9xvau55pd5z6r46
```

***

Now that we have our asset id / fingerprint that we want to monitor, we are ready to look at the filters and commands we will use. For this example, we will use:

* Filter Asset
* Filter Type
* Output

## Filter Asset

We can use the asset fingerprint from above for cTOSI to have Adder track transactions with that fingerprint by using the following filter:

```
-filter-asset asset1uaxup2yv695uat3chgwqtpg9xvau55pd5z6r46
```

## Filter Type - Transaction

For this example, we want to get alerts when a transaction occurs using the cTOSI asset id / fingerprint. To do this we will add the following filter:

```
-filter-type chainsync.transaction
```

## Output

We want the output to be a desktop notification. So that when a transaction that contains cTOSI occurs, we will receive a desktop notification. To do this we will add the following command:

```
-output notify
```



***

## Putting it All Together

To get desktop notifications when a transaction includes the Tosidrop token cTOSI, we will run the following command in our command prompt:

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Please adjust the path to your Adder exe. In this example it's on the Desktop for user richm.


```
C:\Users\richm\Desktop\adder-v0.26.0-windows-amd64.exe -filter-type chainsync.transaction -filter-asset asset1uaxup2yv695uat3chgwqtpg9xvau55pd5z6r46 -output notify
```


### Congratulations!

Now you can minimize the window and let Adder run in the background. Anytime a transaction occurs containing cTOSI you will get a desktop alert.
