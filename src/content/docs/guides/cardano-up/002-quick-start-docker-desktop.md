This guide will walk you through how to use cardano-up on Windows using Docker Desktop. 

To get started follow the steps below

## Step 2 - Get path for Adder exe

Next, we will need to get the path of the Adder exe file that we downloaded so we can run it in the command line.

In this example we downloaded the Adder exe to our desktop, so we can right click on the Adder exe and copy path.

📝 Take note of the path we will need it moving forward ✅

## Step 3 - Run Adder in Command Prompt

Now that we have the path for the Adder exe, type the path in or paste it if you copied the path in the previous step.

### Congratulations!

Now we are ready to run Adder with filters and commands so we can track certain information and pick the way we are notified.

> 💡 TIP: You can get a list of all available commands by using the `-h` or `-help` flag.

We are now ready to walk through some [examples](../examples/001-using-adder-examples-desc) on the usefulness and power 💪 of Adder!
