# Dingo

A Cardano blockchain data node written in Go which actively participates in network communications on the Cardano blockchain using the Ouroboros Network Node-to-Node family of mini-protocols.

‚ö†Ô∏è This is a work in progress and is currently under heavy development

<br>

***

For this guide we will walk you through setting up a `systemd` service. Using a `systemd` service to run a Dingo Node maximizes the uptime by automatically restarting the dingo when the computer reboots. To get started follow the steps below.

<br>

‚úÖ This guide assumes typical Linux setup. Please adjust commands and paths as needed.

***

<br>

## Step 1 - Move Dingo and dingo.yaml Files  

Best Practices: Since we will be using a `systemd` to startup Dingo we will move our Dingo Binary to the `/usr/local/bin/` and our dingo.yaml to the `/etc/dingo/` directory by running the following:

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Please adjust path below. Paths are based on our [Quick Start](../002-quick-start-overview) guide and `USER=test`.
> üí° Tip: to find your path to dingo you can run the `realpath dingo` command.

```
sudo mv /home/test/dingo/dingo /usr/local/bin/
```

> ‚úÖ You can check that dingo was moved by running `which dingo`

Now we will create the `/etc/dingo/` directory:

```
sudo mkdir /etc/dingo/
```

and then move our dingo.yaml file to `/etc/dingo/`:

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Please adjust path below. Paths are based on `USER=test`

```
sudo mv /home/test/dingo/dingo.yaml /etc/dingo/
```

***

<br>

## Step 2 - Create dingo.service Unit Configuration File

Next, we will write the dingo.service unit configuration file (i.e., 'service' file), which will be run by `systemd`.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Please adjust the `User=` line. In our [Quick Start](../002-quick-start-overview) guide we used the user `test` please adjust this to your username.  
> üí° Tip: you can run `echo $USER` command to find your username.

```
cat <<'ENDFILE' >> /tmp/dingo.service
[Unit]
Description=Dingo Node
After=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=10
User=test
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/dingo
SyslogIdentifier=dingo
TimeoutStopSec=3

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
ENDFILE
```

***

<br>

## Step 3 - Move dingo.service

Move dingo.service to `/etc/systemd/system/` so it can operate via systemd by running:

```
sudo mv /tmp/dingo.service /etc/systemd/system/
```

***

## Step 4 - Edit Paths in dingo.yaml File 

#### Add paths to dingo.yaml
We will add a path to our topology file and double check our path to our Cardano config.json file. If you used a different path than `./config/cardano/preview` please adjust as needed.

```
# Example config file for dingo
# The values shown below correspond to the in-code defaults

# Public bind address for the Dingo server
bindAddr: "0.0.0.0"

# Path to the Cardano node configuration file
#
# Can be overridden with the config environment variable
cardanoConfig: "./config/cardano/preview/config.json"

# A directory which contains the ledger database files
databasePath: ".dingo"

# Path to the UNIX domain socket file used by the server
socketPath: "dingo.socket"

# Name of the Cardano network
network: "preview"

# TLS certificate file path (for HTTPS)
#
# Can be overridden with the TLS_CERT_FILE_PATH environment variable
tlsCertFilePath: ""

# TLS key file path (for HTTPS)
#
# Can be overridden with the TLS_KEY_FILE_PATH environment variable
tlsKeyFilePath: ""

# Path to the topology configuration file for Cardano node
topology: "./config/cardano/preview/topology.json"

# TCP port to bind for Prometheus metrics endpoint
metricsPort: 12798

# Internal/private address to bind for listening for Ouroboros NtC
privateBindAddr: "127.0.0.1"

# TCP port to bind for listening for Ouroboros NtC
privatePort: 3002

# TCP port to bind for listening for Ouroboros NtN
#
# Can be overridden with the port environment variable
relayPort: 3001

# TCP port to bind for listening for UTxO RPC
utxorpcPort: 9090

# Ignore prior chain history and start from current tip (default: false)
# This is experimental and may break ‚Äî use with caution
intersectTip: false

# Maximum cache size in bytes used by BadgerDB for block/index cache
# Default: 1073741824 (1 GB)
badgerCacheSize: 1073741824

# Maximum total size (in bytes) of all transactions allowed in the mempool.
# Transactions exceeding this limit will be rejected.
# Default: 1048576 (1 MB)
mempoolCapacity: 1048576
```

## Step 5 - Enable the Service and Start Service

Now we will enable the service to run at start and turn it on by running:

```
sudo systemctl enable dingo.service
```

Then:

```
sudo systemctl start dingo.service
```

***

<br>

## Step 6 - Check Status

You can ensure that dingo.service is active by checking its status by running:

```
sudo systemctl status dingo.service
```
