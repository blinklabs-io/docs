# Tx Submit API

Tx Submit API is a Cardano transaction submit API service written in Go which takes CBOR encoded transaction payloads over HTTP and converts it to the Ouroboros Network LocalTxSubmission mini-protocol via gOuroboros. This project was funded in Project Catalyst Fund 9.

Tx Submit API submits transactions over HTTP making it a faster option over Cardano Submit API.
