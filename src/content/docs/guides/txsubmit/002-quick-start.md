# Quick Start

Tx Submit API is a Cardano transaction submit API service written in Go which takes CBOR encoded transaction payloads over HTTP and converts it to the Ouroboros Network LocalTxSubmission mini-protocol via gOuroboros. This project was funded in Project Catalyst Fund 9.

Tx Submit API submits transactions over HTTP making it a faster option for submitting transaction to the Cardano blockchain.

Simply download the Tx Submit API binary file from blinklabs.io on to your node server. Then run Tx Submit API in the server command line. Configuration can be done using a config file or setting environment variables 

To get started follow the steps below

‚ö†Ô∏è This guide assumes typical Linux Cardano Node setup. Please adjust commands and paths as needed.

***

## Step 1 - Download binary from Blinklabs  
<br>

**Step 1-A** - First start by going to <a href="https://blinklabs.io/projects-open-source" target="_blank">https://blinklabs.io/projects-open-source</a> and scroll down to Tx Submit API.

<br>

**Step 1-B** - Select the operating system of your node server.

<br>

**Step 1-C** - You can either download the binary file and move the file to your node server or...

<br>

Copy the path from Blinklabs and run the following command to download the binary file on your node server  

![txsubmit-blinklabs-site-copy-link](/txsubmit-blinklabs-site-copy-link.png)
<br>

‚ö†Ô∏è Adjust the link path to the correct path for the version you want to download. 

```
wget -cO - https://github.com/blinklabs-io/tx-submit-api/releases/download/v0.20.7/tx-submit-api-v0.20.7-linux-amd64 > tx-submit-api
```

***

## Step 2 - Change Permissions

For this example, we named the binary file `tx-submit-api` and saved the file to our `$NODE_HOME` folder. To make the file executable run the following command:

‚ö†Ô∏è Adjust the file path and file name if needed. 

```
chmod +x $NODE_HOME/tx-submit-api
```

***

## Step 3 - Setup Config File

üí° Tip: To find the path to your node socket run the following command:

```
echo $CARDANO_NODE_SOCKET_PATH
```

***

## Step 4 - Run Tx Submit API With Config File

Run the executable file by running the following with the command line flag `-config` to set the file to load as a configuration.

‚ö†Ô∏è Adjust the file path below to match your path to the `config.yml` file.

```
cd $NODE_HOME
./tx-submit-api -config /path/to/config.yml
```

### Congratulations you are ready to start submitting transactions with Tx Submit API!

<br>

To submit transactions using Tx Submit API using your wallet we will need to setup a `custom submit endpoint` in your wallet setting. See our [setting up your wallet to use Tx Submit API](../003-setting-up-wallet-using-custom-submit-endpoint) guide.

<!--

#### üí° Tip: TxTop connects to the Cardano node using the socket.  
A user can set these variables on their system through their environment variables to modify the behavior.

- `NETWORK`, `CARDANO_NETWORK` - these set the network name, if both are given, NETWORK "wins" so it works out of the box in a `cardano-node` container, defaults to mainnet
- `CARDANO_NODE_NETWORK_MAGIC` - (optional) Manually configure network magic
- `CARDANO_NODE_SOCKET_PATH` - Sets path to UNIX socket of node, defaults to
    /opt/cardano/ipc/socket unless NETWORK is set, then uses /ipc/node.socket
- `CARDANO_NODE_SOCKET_TCP_HOST` - Sets the TCP host for NtC communication
    (socat), defaults to empty
- `CARDANO_NODE_SOCKET_TCP_PORT` - Sets the TCP port for NtC communication
    (socat), defaults to 30001
